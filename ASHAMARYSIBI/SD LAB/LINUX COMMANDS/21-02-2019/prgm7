more command in Linux with Examples

more command is used to view the text files in the command prompt, displaying on
e screen at a time in case the file is large (For example log files). The more c
ommand also allows the user do scroll up and down through the page. The syntax a
long with options and command is as follows. Another application of more is to u
se it with some other command after a pipe. When output is large, we can use mor
e command to see output one by one.

Syntax:

    more [-options] [-num] [+/pattern] [+linenum] [file_name]

    [-options]: any option that you want to use in order to change the way the f
ile is displayed.
    Choose any one from the following-:
    (-d, -l, -f, -p, -c, -s, -u)
    [-num]: type the number of lines that you want to display per screen.
    [+/pattern]: replace pattern with any string that you want to find in the te
xt file.
    [+linenum]: use the line number from where you want to start displaying the 
text content.

Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the 
other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.

For the purposes of this page, we use the term “Linux” to refer to the Linux kernel, but also the set of programs, tools, and services that ar
e typically bundled together with the Linux kernel to provide all of the necessary components of a fully functional operating system. Some peo
ple, particularly members of the Free Software Foundation, refer to this collection as GNU/Linux, because many of the tools included are GNU c
omponents. However, not all Linux installations use GNU components as a part of their operating system. Android, for example, uses a Linux ker
nel but relies very little on GNU tools.
How does Linux differ from other operating systems?

In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, OS X, or iOS. Like other operating system
s, Linux has a graphical interface, and types of software you are accustomed to using on other operating systems, such as word processing appl
ications, have Linux equivalents. In many cases, the software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other sys
tems. If you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.

But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source sof
tware. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribut
e to.

Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of 
Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word
 processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and oth
er user-interface components.

How does Linux differ from other operating systems?

In many ways, Linux is similar to other operating systems you may have used before, such as Windows, OS X, or iOS. Like other operating system
s, Linux has a graphical interface, and types of software you are accustomed to using on other operating systems, such as word processing appl
ications, have Linux equivalents. In many cases, the software’s creator may have made a Linux version of the same program you use on other sys
tems. If you can use a computer or other electronic device, you can use Linux.

But Linux also is different from other operating systems in many important ways. First, and perhaps most importantly, Linux is open source sof
tware. The code used to create Linux is free and available to the public to view, edit, and—for users with the appropriate skills—to contribut
e to.

Linux is also different in that, although the core pieces of the Linux operating system are generally common, there are many distributions of 
Linux, which include different software options. This means that Linux is incredibly customizable, because not just applications, such as word
 processors and web browsers, can be swapped out. Linux users also can choose core components, such as which system displays graphics, and oth
er user-interface components.

Linux is the best-known and most-used open source operating system. As an operating system, Linux is software that sits underneath all of the 
other software on a computer, receiving requests from those programs and relaying these requests to the computer’s hardware.

For the purposes of this page, we use the term “Linux” to refer to the Linux kernel, but also the set of programs, tools, and services that ar
e typically bundled together with the Linux kernel to provide all of the necessary components of a fully functional operating system. Some peo
